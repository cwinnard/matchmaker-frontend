From the development branch, create a new branch that will contain your feature. It is preferred that all feature branches are written in lower kebob case and prefixed with feature/. Example: feature/improve-matchmaking-logic

Implement your feature in that branch, committing often with descriptive commit messages. Pull the latest development branch and merge it into your feature branch often to avoid conflicts upon copmletion. When finished, open a pull request to the development branch. Provide a consice but descriptive comments on the intended improvements in the feature branch as well as so insight into how and why you did what you did. Approved PRs will be merged into the development branch.
